# SQL Insights in MySQL

**Subject:** Database Management System (MySQL)  
**Name:** Abdanur

## 📌 Project Description
This repository contains a small collection of SQL scripts and queries for practicing MySQL.  
The goal is to explore how to write clean queries, analyze data, and generate useful insights from database tables.

## 💡 Features
- Practice SQL queries for data analysis
- Filtering, sorting, and aggregation (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
- GROUP BY / HAVING for reports
- JOINs between multiple tables
- Simple “insight” queries for understanding the data

## 📦 Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MnstrsParago/DBMS.MySQL.Insights.git
   cd DBMS.MySQL.Insights
   ```
2. Open your MySQL tool (MySQL Workbench / DBeaver / CLI).
3. Import or create the database schema (if a `.sql` schema file exists in the repo).
4. Run the SQL files / queries and check the results.

## 📘 Reflection
This project helped me improve my SQL thinking: how to break a question into steps and turn it into a query.  
It also improved my understanding of JOINs and aggregations for building simple reports. I hope one day I will start doing SQL tasks on LeetCode or on SQL_Academy
